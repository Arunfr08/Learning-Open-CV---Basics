# ðŸ§  OpenCV Basics â€” Learning Projects

This repository contains my practice projects while learning the fundamentals of OpenCV and computer vision with Python.  
It includes experiments in:
- Drawing shapes and text on images  
- Performing image transformations (translation, rotation, flipping, cropping)  
- Resizing images and live video frames

ðŸ“š Built as part of my OpenCV learning journey!
