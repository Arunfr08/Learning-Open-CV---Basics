## 📂 Projects Included
1. **Draw Shapes (`draw.py`)**
   - Draws lines, circles, rectangles, and text using OpenCV.
   - Includes an interactive program to draw selected shapes.

2. **Image Transformations (`image_transformation.py`)**
   - Translation, rotation, resizing, flipping, and cropping.
   - Menu-based program for experimenting with transformations.

3. **Resize Video and Image (`resize.py`)**
   - Demonstrates image and video frame resizing using webcam input.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
python draw_shapes/draw.py
```

## 🏁 Goal
To practice and understand fundamental OpenCV functions before moving to advanced topics like edge detection, contours, and face recognition.
